	abstract = {The Tritium Migration Analysis Program, Version 7 (TMAP7) code is an update of TMAP4, an earlier version that was verified and validated in support of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) program and of the intermediate version TMAP2000. It has undergone several revisions. The current one includes radioactive decay, multiple trap capability, more realistic treatment of heteronuclear molecular formation at surfaces, processes that involve surface-only species, and a number of other improvements. Prior to code utilization, it needed to be verified and validated to ensure that the code is performing as it was intended and that its predictions are consistent with physical reality. To that end, the demonstration and comparison problems cited here show that the code results agree with analytical solutions for select problems where analytical solutions are straightforward or with results from other verified and validated codes, and that actual experimental results can be accurately replicated using reasonable models with this code. These results and their documentation in this report are necessary steps in the qualification of TMAP7 for its intended service.},

	abstract = {The Tritium Migration Analysis Program MODl/CY04 (TMAP4) was written to be used in analyzing experiments and for safety calculations that involve the injection, solution, diffusion, trapping, release, and other related processes experienced by hydrogen isotopes in materials. Because of the desire to make it suitable for analyzing safety issues, it is important that TMAP4 be certified (verified and validated) at Quality Assurance Level A. This report documents the work done to achieve that certification. The process includes assuring that the developed code meets the software requirements specified in the Software Quality Assurance Plan, verifying that the code functions in accordance with the written description and that it is self-consistent and internally correct, and validating that its computed results are in agreement with experimental data and/or known analytical solutions. Quality Level A certification for TMAP4 is specifically for implementation on an IBM PS/2 Model 70 operating under DOS 5.0. Certification for any other environment will require demonstration that all of the verification and validation tests documented here give the same results in the new environment.},

	abstract = {Relevant parameters for trapping of Hydrogen Isotopes (HIs) in polycrystalline tungsten are determined with the MHIMS code (Migration of Hydrogen Isotopes in MaterialS) which is used to reproduce Thermal Desorption Spectrometry experiments. Three types of traps are found: two intrinsic traps (detrapping energy of 0.87 eV and 1.00 eV) and one extrinsic trap created by ion irradiation (detrapping energy of 1.50 eV). Then MHIMS is used to simulate HIs retention at different fluences and different implantation temperatures. Simulation results agree well with experimental data. It is shown that at 300 K the retention is limited by diffusion in the bulk. For implantation temperatures above 500 K, the retention is limited by trap creation processes. Above 600 K, the retention drops by two orders of magnitude as compared to the retention at 300 K. With the determined detrapping energies, HIs outgassing at room temperature is predicted. After ions implantation at 300 K, 45\% of the initial retention is lost to vacuum in 300 000 s while during this time the remaining trapped HIs diffuse twice as deep into the bulk.},

	abstract = {Tritium self-sufficiency presents a critical engineering challenge for DEMO, requiring efficient breeding and extraction systems, as well as minimizing tritium losses to the surrounding systems, such as plasma-facing components, vacuum vessel, cooling system, etc. Structural and plasma-facing components will act as a tritium sink, as tritium will be accumulated in the bulk of these components due to energetic particle bombardment and may permeate out of the vacuum system. The design of the plasma-facing components will consequently directly influence the plant lifetime, operational safety and cost of any future power plant. Therefore, modeling of tritium retention and permeation in these components is required for the engineering designs of the tritium breeding and safety systems. In this work, the diffusion-transport code TESSIM-X is benchmarked against the well-established TMAP7 code and a comparison with a simplified DEMO-relevant test case is performed. The use of either code for modeling of DEMO conditions is discussed. Following this, TESSIM-X is used to provide a preliminary assessment of tritium permeation and retention in the DEMO first wall, based on the current WCLL (Water Cooled Lithium Lead) and HCPB (Helium Cooled Pebble Bed) breeding blanket designs.},

TPD results are simulated to fit D trapping parameters that are in turn applied to simulate the LID. TPD results are compared to equivalent results from JET-ILW and UCSD samples. HiPIMS samples show a different release behavior compared to UCSD and JET samples, release peaks at comparable heating rates are narrower and cannot be modelled using the same set of parameters. With a particular choice of diffusion-trapping parameters that reproduce the TPD peak positions, modelling of the LID efficiency results in a qualitative agreement with experimental observations. In particular, it is shown that a complete outgassing of low D content samples is not possible during laser heating unless the surface temperature exceeds the Be melting threshold.},

	abstract = {The accurate prediction of tritium inventory and permeation fluxes in the breeding blanket of a D-T fusion reactor is a key aspect for future thermonuclear power plants licensing. Tritium permeation into structural materials could give rise to potential issues concerning the fuel self-sufficiency and can be lost into the environment with resulting radiological risks for the population. In the frame of hydrogen isotopes transport modelling, the Tritium Migration Analysis Program (TMAP) code is considered a referred code for the safety design of nuclear fusion power plants. It is mainly applied to Plasma Facing Components (PFCs), which are subjected to intense particles implantation and surface heat fluxes. Due to some code limitations and to the need of having a more easy-to-use computer code in a multiphysics framework, in the last years the commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics has been used to assess tritium transport studies as an application to ITER, DEMO and CFETR fusion reactors, but it was never validated against TMAP. Within this paper, a COMSOL-based code named mHIT (multi-trapping Hydrogen Isotopes Transport code) is presented. A set of verification and validation (V\&V) problems were addressed, with the aim of substantiating the capabilities of the code in common fusion-relevant experimental set-ups and to include different physics according to the level of detail needed for a given application.},

FESTIM has been validated by reproducing experimental data and the Method of Manufactured Solutions was used for analytical verification. Following relevant plasma scenarios, both transient heat transfer and hydrogen isotopes (HIs) diffusion have been simulated in order to assess HIs retention in monoblocks. Relevant materials properties have been used. Each plasma cycle is composed of a current ramp up, a current plateau, a current ramp down and a resting phase before the following shot. 100 cycles are simulated. The total HIs inventory in the tokamak during resting phases reaches 1.8 √ó 10 3 mg whereas during the implantation phases it keeps increasing as a power law of time. Particle flux on the cooling channel of the monoblock is also computed. The breakthrough time is estimated to be t = 1 √ó 105 s which corresponds to 24 cycles. Relevance of 2D modelling has been demonstrated by comparing the total HIs inventory obtained by 2D and 1D simulations. Using 1D simulations, a relative error is observed compared to 2D simulations which can reach -25\% during the resting phase. The error during implantation phases keeps increasing.},

	abstract = {The primary focus of this chapter is on the use of exact solutions to mathematical models for code verification. Recall that, in some cases, software testing can be performed by simply running the code and comparing the results to the correct code output. However, in scientific computing, ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù code output depends on the chosen spatial mesh, time step, iterative convergence tolerance, machine precision, etc. We are thus forced to rely on other less definitive methods for assessing code correctness. In Chapter 5, the order of accuracy test was argued to be the most rigorous approach for code verification. When the order of accuracy test fails, or when the formal order of accuracy has not been determined, then the less rigorous convergence test may be used. In either case, an exact solution to the underlying mathematical model is required. When used for code verification, the ability of this exact solution to exercise all terms in the mathematical model is more important than any physical realism of the solution. In fact, realistic exact solutions are often avoided for code verification due to the presence of singularities and/or discontinuities. Numerous examples will be given in this chapter of exact solutions and their use with the order verification test. The final example given in this chapter employs the less rigorous convergence test with benchmark numerical solutions. In addition to code verification applications, exact solutions to mathematical models are extremely valuable for evaluating the accuracy of numerical schemes, determining solution sensitivity to mesh quality and topology, evaluating the reliability of discretization error estimators, and evaluating solution adaptation schemes. For these secondary applications, physically realistic exact solutions are preferred (see Section 6.4).},
