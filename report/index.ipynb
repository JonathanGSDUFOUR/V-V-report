    "Welcome to the FESTIM Verification and Validation (V&V) book! This book aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the verification and validation processes conducted for the FESTIM code. Through a series of verification and validation cases, we aim to demonstrate the accuracy, reliability, and applicability of FESTIM for simulating hydrogen transport phenomena.\n",

    "\n",
    "This book has been generated using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/), an open-source tool for building interactive and collaborative online books using Jupyter Notebooks. Jupyter Book enables us to seamlessly integrate code, text, equations, and visualisations, providing an interactive and transparent platform for presenting our verification and validation results. By utilising Jupyter Book, we aim to ensure the reproducibility of our results and provide readers with the ability to explore and interact with the code and data presented in this book."
