# Verification and Validation (V&V)

Verification and Validation (V&V) are essential processes in software development, especially in scientific computing. While both are crucial, they serve distinct purposes, collectively ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the code.

Both verification and validation are indispensable in software development. While verification ensures the correctness of the code's implementation, validation ensures the code's relevance and accuracy in representing real-world phenomena. Neglecting either process can lead to unreliable simulations and erroneous conclusions.

In the context of FESTIM, rigorous verification and validation processes are integral to ensuring the code's reliability and utility across diverse applications. By meticulously verifying the code's implementation and validating its predictive capabilities against experimental data, FESTIM aims to provide users with a robust and trustworthy tool for simulating hydrogen transport phenomena.

## Verification

Verification focuses on answering the question, "Are we building the code right?" This process involves confirming that the code faithfully implements the intended algorithms and equations without introducing errors or inaccuracies. Verification ensures that the software behaves as expected under various conditions and correctly solves the governing equations.

**Questions to Consider for Verification:**
- Does the code accurately implement the mathematical models?
- Are the numerical methods correctly applied?
- Are boundary conditions handled appropriately?
- Are there any programming errors or bugs?

Verification typically involves rigorous testing, code reviews, and comparison with analytical solutions or method of manufactured solutions (MMS). By verifying the code, developers can identify and rectify errors before proceeding to validation.

## Validation

Validation, on the other hand, addresses the question, "Are we building the right tool?" This process assesses whether the code accurately represents the real-world phenomena it aims to simulate. Validation involves comparing the model predictions with experimental data or empirical observations to ensure that the simulated results align with reality.

**Questions to Consider for Validation:**
- Do the simulation results match experimental data within acceptable margins of error?
- Are the model assumptions valid for the intended application?
- Does the code capture the essential physical phenomena accurately?
- Are there any discrepancies between simulated and observed behaviors?

Validation provides confidence that the simulation accurately represents the physical system of interest. However, it's essential to recognize that validation alone is insufficient. Even if a code successfully reproduces experimental observations, it may still contain inherent errors or bugs if not adequately verified.
